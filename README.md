# üîß Resolve CI Variables Action

‚ö°Ô∏è Run your CI workflows with multiple triggers. Stop writing custom bash variable resolvers, and end your if/then expression nightmares.

This action simplifies resolving variables, evaluating expressions, and defining fallback behaviors. The action supports three types of resolution:

This action is designed to make your workflows more maintainable by:

- Coalescing the first non-empty value from a list of inputs
- Evaluating Jinja2 expressions
- Emitting both flat outputs and structured results
- Optionally logging results and writing a step summary

## üî§ Variable Resolution

Learn more about each resolution type:

- [Direct Assignment](#direct-assignment)
  - E.g. `var1=my value`
- [Jinja Expression Assignment](#jinja-expression-assignment)
  - E.g. `var1=true ? 'great' : 'not great'`
- [Standard CI Vars](#standard-ci-vars)
  - Standard CI Vars. Automatic resolution of canned variables and defined inputs. We handle a number of common use cases for you, saving you time, code lines, and troubleshooting time.

### Direct Assignment

Direct variable assignment is provided with the `static_inputs` input arg.

The `static_inputs` parameter takes variable assignments in `key=value` format:

```yml
    with:
      static_inputs:
        answer=42
        question=What is the meaning of life?
```

More likely, you will use GitHub expressions to resolve these variables:

```yml
    with:
      static_inputs:
        answer=${{ github.inputs.something || github.inputs.else }}
```

The benefit of this approach is that subsequent action steps can simply pull the
resolved variable, rather than repeating the expression everywhere it is needed.

### Jinja Expression Assignment

Jinja expressions provide a powerful balance between expressiveness and simplicity.

You can leave off the normal `{{` and `}}` wrappers and provide any valid jinja2 expression.

```yml
    with:
      jinja_inputs: |
        answer=40 + 2
        question='What is the meaning' + 'of life?'
```

Just as with static inputs, you can use GitHub expressions to inject variables into the
jinja expression:

```yml
    with:
      jinja_inputs: |
        token='${{ inputs.custom_token }}' or '${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}'
        environment='${{ inputs.environment }}' or ('main' if '${{ github.ref }}' == 'refs/heads/main' else 'dev')
        api_url='${{ vars.CUSTOM_API_URL }}' or 'https://api.example.com'
```

- [Jinja2 Cheat Sheet](https://devhints.io/jinja) - Quick syntax reference

### Standard CI Vars

The action automatically resolves common CI variables from GitHub context, eliminating the need for complex expressions like `${{ github.event.pull_request.head.repo.full_name || github.repository }}` throughout your workflows.

#### Standard CI Variables Reference

#### Usage Example

```yaml
- name: Resolve CI variables
  id: vars
  uses: aaronsteers/resolve-ci-vars-action@v1
  with:
    static_inputs: |
      custom_var=my_value

- name: Use resolved variables
  run: |
    echo "PR Number: ${{ steps.vars.outputs.pr-number }}"
    echo "Resolved Branch: ${{ steps.vars.outputs.resolved-git-branch }}"
    echo "Repository: ${{ steps.vars.outputs.resolved-repo-name-full }}"
    echo "All variables: ${{ steps.vars.outputs.custom }}"
```

#### Workflow Dispatch Auto-Detection

The action automatically detects and resolves common workflow_dispatch inputs:

- **PR inputs**: `pr` or `pr-number` - Automatically resolves PR context and updates resolved variables to point to PR head
- **Comment inputs**: `comment-id` - Resolves comment metadata for slash command workflows  
- **Issue inputs**: `issue-id` or `issue-number` - Resolves issue context and constructs URLs

```yaml
# Example workflow_dispatch with auto-detected inputs
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      pr-number:
        description: 'PR number to operate on'
        required: false
      comment-id:
        description: 'Comment ID that triggered this'
        required: false
      issue-number:
        description: 'Issue number'
        required: false

jobs:
  example:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: aaronsteers/resolve-ci-vars-action@v1
        id: vars
      # All workflow_dispatch inputs are now available as resolved variables
      - run: echo "Operating on PR: ${{ steps.vars.outputs.pr-number }}"
```

**Key Features:**
- **Smart resolved context**: `resolved-*` variables always point to the effective working context (PR head for PRs, current branch otherwise)
- **Explicit PR source/target**: Separate `pr-source-*` and `pr-target-*` variables for fine-grained PR workflows
- **URL generation**: Automatic GitHub URLs for branches, commits, PRs, and comments
- **Fork-aware**: Properly distinguishes between source and target repositories in fork scenarios
- **Context detection**: `is-pr` boolean and other metadata for workflow logic
- **Workflow dispatch auto-detection**: Automatically detects and resolves `pr`/`pr-number`, `comment-id`, and `issue-id`/`issue-number` inputs

## üìö Examples

### Basic fallback with static inputs

```yaml

with:
  jinja_inputs: |
    team='${{ inputs.team }}' or 'unknown'
```

## üîê Security

Sensitive values should not be logged unless you are confident they are masked.
Use `log_outputs: true` or `non_sensitive: true` only for safe-to-print variables.
